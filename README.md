## Background:
A friend of mine who works doing Video Playback in the entertainment industry told me he was thinking
about using a Raspberry Pi to loop media for the scenes he was shooting. 
I decided to help him out by building a simple media player to loop the media he needed.

<b>This application can be installed on a Raspberry Pi to seamlessly loop videos and images.</b>

## Running the Application:
### Installing Dependencies:
Ensure the following are installed on the machine you are running the application on:
- Python 2.7 with pip
- virtualenv for Python 2.7

Create a virtualenv and install the requirements from <i>requirements.txt</i> with pip
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r "requirements.txt"
```
