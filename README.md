## Background:
A friend of mine who works in the entertainment industry told me he was thinking
about using a Raspberry Pi to loop media for the scenes he was shooting. We couldn't find
any good pre-built programs to display images or loop media so I decided to build an 
application with an easy to use GUI to do just that. 

<b>This application can be installed on a Raspberry Pi to seamlessly loop videos and display images.</b>

Note: This application is Linux and Windows compatible, but far more robust media applications exist.

## Using the Application:
### Install Dependencies:
Ensure the following are installed on the machine you are running the application on:
- Python 2.7 with pip
- virtualenv for Python 2.7
- vlc (sudo apt-get vlc)

Create a virtualenv and install the requirements from <i>requirements.txt</i> with pip
```
$ virtualenv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install -r "requirements.txt"
``` 
### Run the Application:
Clone this repository to a folder of your choice, navigate to the folder containing
<i>driver.py</i> and run it.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Topazoo/Seamless_Media_Looper.git
$ cd Seamless_Media_Looper
$ python driver.py
```
If all dependencies are installed correctly, the GUI will open.

### Navigating the GUI: 
Each GUI tab represents a different storage device. All attached USB drives are
displayed.
- Click on a tab or press tab then an arrow key to change tabs. 
- Double click or press Enter on any directory to display its contents.
- Double click or press Enter on any image file to display it in fullscreen.
- Double click or press Enter on any video file to loop it in fullscreen.
- Press Escape to exit any media being displayed.
